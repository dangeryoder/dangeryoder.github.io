	<h2>What is "PROJECT BLACKJACK"?</h2>
	<p><a href="http://www.google.com">PROJECT BLACKJACK</a> is a python-based blackjack
	game that uses simple functions we already learned in this
	class.</p> <p>It is run off of a 'while' loop, and includes several 
	if-statements along with a random card number generator.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<h2>Reflection</h2>
	<p>Creating this game was no simple feat.
	It still doesn't work completely, something</p>
	<p>that I attribute to user error if anyone were to ask.
	The hardest part of this project was the implementation</p>
	<p>of 'break' and doing what I could to make sure the game ended when 
	it was supposed to (dealer busts, you bust, you decide to stay, etc.).</p>
	<p>This game was a learning experience in both coding and patience.</p>
