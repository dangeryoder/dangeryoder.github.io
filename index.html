	<h2>What is "PROJECT BLACKJACK"?</h2>
	<p><a href="https://github.com/dangeryoder/dangeryoder.github.io">PROJECT BLACKJACK</a> is a python-based blackjack
	game that uses simple functions we already learned in this
	class.</p> <p>It is run off of a 'while' loop, and includes several 
	if-statements along with a random card number generator.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<h2>Reflection</h2>
	<p>Creating this game was no simple feat.
	It still doesn't work completely, something</p>
	<p>that I attribute to user error if anyone were to ask.
	The hardest part of this project was the implementation</p>
	<p>of 'break' and doing what I could to make sure the game ended when 
	it was supposed to (dealer busts, you bust, you decide to stay, etc.).</p>
	<p>This game was a learning experience in both coding and patience.</p>
	<p> </p>

	<h2> In-Game Play </h2>

	<p> What we have here is the first part of the game. The player is given </p>
	<p>1000 dollars to start with, and before you can do anything, the game prompts </p>
	<p>you to enter how much you want to bet. The game then takes your answer, and </p>
	<p>depending on whether you win or lose, it gives or takes away money. Once you </p>
	<p>enter the money you want to bet, the game deals you two cards that are randomly </p>
	<p>selected and a prompt pops up asking if you would like another card.</p>
	<p>                                                                                </p>

	<p> This is what happens after you ask for another card. It deals you one more and if </p>
	<p>you get a 21, then the game recognizes that you won and it pays you. But if you didn't win, </p> 
	<p>then the dealer deals himself two cards. If he has less than 17 total, then he keeps adding </p>
	<p>cards until he reaches 17, even if he busts, just like in real blackjack. </p>

	<p>Here is the piece of code I had the most trouble getting to work. I spent several </p> 
	<p>days trying to figure out why the game wouldn't end sometimes when the dealer busted, </p>
	<p>or if the player busted. The code essentially says that if the dealer's two cards he </p>
	<p>deals to himself are under 17, he's supposed to deal himself one card at a time until</p>
	<p>he gets above 21. Then there is an if-elif-else that holds the requirements for </p>
	<p>winning or losing. this code still doesn't work all the time and I can't figure out why.</p>
